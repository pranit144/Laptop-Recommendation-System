## Project Overview

The Laptop Recommendation System is a web-based application that enables users to find their ideal laptop by providing details such as their persona, usage, and technical preferences. The project uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions and provide recommendations.

---

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive form to capture user preferences.
- **Customizable Recommendations:** Select criteria such as persona, processor, RAM, graphics, storage, and more.
- **ML-Powered Predictions:** Uses ensemble learning models for accurate laptop recommendations.
- **Dynamic Responses:** Displays recommendations based on user inputs.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- Python (Flask Framework)
- pandas (DataFrame handling)
- joblib (Model serialization and deserialization)

### Frontend:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom styles)
- Jinja2 (Flask templating engine)

### Machine Learning:
- Ensemble Classifier (trained with user preference data)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-recommendation-system.git
   cd laptop-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
